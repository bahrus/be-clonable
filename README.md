# be-clonable

be-clonable is a web component decorator, that adds or hydrates a triggering button, and enables that button to clone the adorned element.

## Syntax

```html
<label be-clonable>
    <input type="checkbox" name="">
    <span>Check me out</span>
</label>
```

In fact, it is a little better from a performance point of view to manually add the button to go along with the attribute, to save the browser or server from having to render it.

```html
<label be-clonable>
    <input type="checkbox" name="">
    <span>Check me out</span>
    <button class="be-clonable-trigger">‚ùè</button>
</label>
```



The button as well as the event handler can be attached programmatically without the need for the custom attribute.  For example, during template instantiation, this may be the optimal approach, and is explicitly supported by the [trans-render](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render#extending-tr-dtr-horizontally) template instantiation library.
